## How to format callouts

```markdown
> [!faq] Heading goes here
> Contents go here and can contain more formatting
```
### Foldable callouts

You can make a callout foldable by adding a plus (+) or a minus (-) directly after the type identifier.

A plus sign expands the callout by default, and a minus sign collapses it instead.

```markdown
> [!faq]- Are callouts foldable?
> Yes! In a foldable callout, the contents are hidden when the callout is collapsed.
```

> [!faq]- Are callouts foldable?
> Yes! In a foldable callout, the contents are hidden when the callout is collapsed.

And its second line.
