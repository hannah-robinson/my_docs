If your method is called for you by an event listener, the browser binds `this` for you to the DOM element that triggered the event e.g. a button. So if you are not using an arrow function, `this` in the `addMovieHandler` function would refer to the button that triggered the event.
```js
const addMovieHandler = function() {
  console.log(this) // console output: <button id="add-btn">Add</button>
}

addMoviebtn.addEventListener('click', addMovieHandler) 
```

>[!warning] Arrow functions don't know `this`
>Functions created with the `function` keyword or the method shorthand have their own `this` bindings which ensure that `this` is bound to whatever is executing the function. Arrow functions don't bind `this` to anything, so `this` refers to the same thing it would refer to outside of the function (whether  or not you are in strict mode)

```js
const addMovieHandler = () => {
  console.log(this) // `this` is the window because this is an arrow function
}

addMoviebtn.addEventListener('click', addMovieHandler) 
```
