You can use any name that could be used to name a variable to name an object property, plus a few more options.

```js
const person = {
"first name": "Fred", //this is uncommon, but possible
1: "Hola",
1.5: "Bom dia"
}

// to access the property values
person[1]
person[1.5]
person["first name"]
```
