```js
const person = {name: "Valerii", age: 30, hobbies: ['sports', 'reading']}

const person2 = { ...person } // spread operator creates a shallow clone, so the hobbies array is just the reference value/address for the original array

const person3 = { ...person, age: 29, hobbies: [...person.hobbies] } // You can overwrite properties of the original array like this and you if can use a 2nd spread operatorr like this to clone the orignal hobbies array, making a new one with its own reference value/address

```
See also [[Object assign method]]. (Spread operator is newer and more convenient (shorter) than `Object.assign()` so use spread operator if you don't need to worry about browser support)
