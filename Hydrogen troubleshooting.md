## Troubleshooting your GitHub connection
Troubleshooting your GitHub connection and identifying errors within a production Hydrogen app on Oxygen is an essential part of maintaining a stable and functional custom storefront. GitHub provides several features that can assist in the troubleshooting process. 

Another important factor to consider when troubleshooting your GitHub connection is that if your organization has SSO enabled, there may be rare situations where the connection to your GitHub account fails but falsely indicates a successful connection. To resolve this issue, you can revoke the access of the Shopify GitHub app to your account in your GitHub settings. Afterward, make sure you are logged in and have an active SAML session before proceeding with the setup process once again.

## Errors within a production Hydrogen app on Oxygen
When encountering an error within a production Hydrogen app on Oxygen, it's crucial to promptly identify and address the issue. Here are some common scenarios you may encounter:

- **Build-time errors:** Check error messages and logs to identify the cause, review dependencies and file structure, resolve conflicts or inconsistencies, and rebuild the app.
    
- **Server runtime errors:** Examine error logs and messages, debug app code and error handling, verify configuration and connectivity with external services, and contact Oxygen host support if needed.
    
- **Client runtime errors:** Inspect browser console for JavaScript errors, test on different browsers and devices, review CSS for conflicts, ensure proper data retrieval and rendering, and consider using polyfills or alternative approaches for unsupported JavaScript APIs.

To troubleshoot and discover the underlying problem within your production Hydrogen app on Oxygen, consider the following steps:

- **Error logs:** Start by examining the error logs to review error messages, stack traces, and other relevant information that can pinpoint the source of the problem. 
    
- **Review recent changes:** Identify any recent changes made to your codebase, configuration settings, or dependencies.
    
- **Testing environment:** Set up a testing environment that closely mirrors your production environment. Replicate the error in the testing environment, as it can provide a controlled environment for debugging and troubleshooting. 
    
- **Utilize monitoring tools:** Leverage monitoring tools to track the performance and behavior of your Hydrogen app server-side errors, resource utilization, response times, and other metrics that aid in identifying and resolving issues.

## Debugging strategies
To effectively debug and resolve the problem in your Hydrogen app, consider the following strategies:

- **Isolate the issue:** Narrow down the scope of the problem by identifying which specific component, module, or feature is causing the error. This helps in focusing your debugging efforts and prevents unnecessary changes to unaffected parts of the codebase. 
    
- **Logging and console output:** Insert strategic log statements and utilize console output to capture relevant information during runtime. This allows you to track the flow of execution, variable values, and error messages, aiding in identifying the root cause of the problem. 
    
- **Code review and analysis:** Conduct a thorough code review to identify any logical or syntactical errors in your codebase. Utilize code analysis tools to detect potential issues, such as unused variables, improper error handling, or performance bottlenecks.
    
- **Incremental testing and deployment:** When making changes to your Hydrogen app, adopt an incremental testing and deployment approach. Test each change individually before moving to the next one, ensuring that you can easily identify the specific change causing the error if issues arise. 
    
- **Collaborate and seek help:** If you're unable to identify and resolve the problem on your own, don't hesitate to seek help. Engage with the Hydrogen developer community, forums, or support channels to collaborate with other developers who may have encountered similar issues or have expertise in troubleshooting Hydrogen apps. GitHub's platform provides a community-driven environment, making it easy to connect with other developers and seek assistance.
