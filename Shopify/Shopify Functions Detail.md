## Extension-only apps
Extension-only apps are custom apps that don't have embedded app pages. Because they're made up entirely of extensions, extension-only apps can be hosted on Shopify. Extension-only apps have a Shopify-populated app URL, which you can optionally change, to build embedded app pages or list your app on the Shopify App Store.

Checkout UI extensions, Shopify Functions and Post-purchase functions can all be created in extension-only apps using the	Shopify CLI.

## Simplified Deployment
Use Simplified Deployment (because from September 5, 2023, all apps will be automatically opted in to use simplified deployment anyway.)
