## VS Code plugins
- GitLens by GitKraken (extension id: eamodio.gitlens)
- Git Graph (extension id: mhutchie.git-graph)

After installing them in VS Code, go to the source control panel (ctrl, shift, G). You'll see GitLens in the left-hand panel.

There will also be a button to open Git Graph. It's the last one in the row.
